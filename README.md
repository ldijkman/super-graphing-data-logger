# super-graphing-data-logger
An arduino sketch for my old super graphing data logger project.

forked from https://github.com/evjrob/super-graphing-data-logger

--------------------------

luberth some changes

\<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60"\> reload htm page every 60 seconds

progres bar on bottom of html page to show when page reloads

-

changed time server to time.google.com  because of jumps to 1970 when i log each second

time should not be read every time from time server

sometimes jumps to unixtime 1970 wich mess up the graph == not nice

fixed some compile errors for main ino


---------------------



first chart maybe nice for https://github.com/ldijkman/Arduino-Drain-Rain-Irrigation-Measure-weight-system

pee measurement howmuch and when ;-)
